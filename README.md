CRUD Operations Project using JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

I recently developed a simple web application that implements CRUD operations (Create - Read - Update - Delete) using pure JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

 Project Objective:
A hands-on project to better understand how to manage data dynamically on the front-end using only JavaScript, with a focus on interacting with the DOM and temporarily storing data using LocalStorage.

 Project Features:

Interactive and user-friendly interface

Ability to add, edit, and delete items

Data persistence using LocalStorage

Clean and scalable code structure

 Technologies Used:

HTML / CSS

JavaScript (Vanilla)
